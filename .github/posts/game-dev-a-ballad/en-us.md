# Game development, a ballad

What's up? Erick here.  _Who else could it be?_

This is not a blog post about how I became a great game developer that went through thick and thin to release my first game, nor how I joined a AAA studio _yet_. No, this is the history on how I managed to give up on learning the very same thing twice, and **Now**, I think I've finally learned to love it.

But before diving into this _"Frieren Mode"_ journey, first I'll need to give a little context about my past with programming... Dialing back a few years (roughly Q3 2018) just after starting college, gettin my feet wet with programming trough 101 classes.

The programming language? **C**. _"Yeah, I know gotta love it, right?"_

Conditionals, loops, functions and error handling, that's all I recall doing on those classes for the semester, while the very barebones nature of C made things a little complicated,I've never hated, avoided or searched for alternatives for the language during that time period, not because I needed to get those grades, but I just liked getting challegend to solve problems from the ground-up it felt... rather thrilling.

Moreover, the next two semesters while still using C I got introduced to the world of **☆*:~..Data Structures~..:*☆**, altough I didn't love it I didn't hate either, stuff just made sense but it didn't peak my interest at the time, little did I know that was my last contact with that language at lease within my academic curriculum.  _"What about graphs you might ask? We learned that using Java...Yeah I'm still salty about that, I was hoping for C++"_

The year is still 2018, while working as a I.T intern at my college during downtime, I stumbled upon a video named "So You Wanna Make Games?? | Episode 1: Intro to Game Art"

[![So You Wanna Make Games?? | Episode 1: Intro to Game Art Thumbnail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pepeien/portfolio/master/.github/posts/game-dev-a-ballad/images/so-you-wanna-make-games.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRoXLLwJ8g)

This awesome video its part 1 of a 11 episode series about how (roughly) Game Development works, I don't know why but their [explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr7XYXMM7-U) about Technical Art got me shooting for that position even though I knew nothing at all about how to make games nor how to make art. _"P.S I still don't"_

At the time I was getting reeled into Web Development, as a consequence I lost contact with C, after watching that video I instantly got the itches to learn game dev as a hobby so I went to google and types _"game engines that use C++"_ yes, that cut on C after learning data structures was just like cutting a puppy short of his mom's milk. Anyways, the first one that popped up was **Unreal Engine**, at the time I think the LTS version was **4.24**, got my 512GB HDD and downloaded UE4 with Visual Studio, booted up and the first thought I had was, _"This UI is ugly"_ having a weak PC and having a packed semester at college really turned me down on messing with unreal.

Jumping towards the end of 2019 the very same company that kindled a little bit of Game Dev spirit inside me a few months back, Riot Games, dropped **this**

A trailer streamed during Riot's 10th Anniversary stream showcasing its new FPS game made with **Unreal Engine**, a first for Riot Games too, being only a **Indie Music Company** at the time, its name? Project A. _"Mysterioussss~"_. Being a CS:GO head during that time (_"I still am"_), this announcement tackled the issues the CS playerbase had for a long time as not present anymore, it was like a love letter for us TTS players, with that they had my attention.

Fast forward two years, before Project A (a.k.a VALORANT official) release, around Q2 2020 the closed beta was announced, and the twitch requirement to get access got me watching all kind of streamers related to VALORANT, one of them was Riot Nu (Marcus Reid) a Riot Games developer that made VALORANT, got the beta key, watched the most of the dev talks and videos available, joined a few discord servers,and submited a few bug reports at r/VALORANT reddit's page, did that for the remaining of the year.

Around 2021, VALORANT had their release and Riot Nu started his series on teaching Game Dev using **Unreal Engine** that my dear readers was my second attempt on unreal's game dev, with someone's guidance and a mildly clear after work/college hours, I stuck through a little longer, even to make basic studies such as

Around the same time, I got a new job as a software developer intern, so, in order to give my all both at the new job and college I dropped unreal _"sigh"_ again.

Fast Forward Q1 2023, graduated, junior web developer, full of spare time and bills while scrolling twitter, I saw this UE 5.3 print screen and it's newly UI and said to myself _"You know what, let me test this thing", downloaded the whole thing, opened for five minutes and closed it, suddenly the CS:GO Source 2 port rumours started rising again but this time, it seemed serious, so as joke with my discord crew (also CS heads) I said _"I'm going to start making CS:GO on unreal with only C++ and going to release it before Valve's"_, so I started my journey.

Well, turns out Valve took that personally and released it CS2 few months after that statement, by then I've already implemented a few things and a **bunch** of bugs like this one

Come to find out that, trying to learn game development while trying to make it mulitplayer is hard.

Q3 2023 still invested in this project having implemented, UI, few sound effects and basic mulitplayer components, such as, teams, damage, and inventory one thing I have to say, is that, even tough I only implemented two weapons to this game, I tried my best to make it as I could implement as much guns I wanted and I'm pretty proud of it. Dialing up to Q4 2023 slowed down a bit to rework my portfolio and finally create a blog, but already envisoing going back to the basics and learn game development using either OpenGL or Vulkan and documentating my journey here at this blog.

That's pretty much it, for now... Hoping this fire stays fiery(?) for a looong time.
